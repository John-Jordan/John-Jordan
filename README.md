âœ¨ I'm a software developer based in Oklahoma. Iâ€™m excited about learning python and interested in data science and web applications. 

Here are some things about me:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python by going through the Data Science in Python learning track from dataquest.io.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Whatever you want, I may have an answer or might be able to direct you to someone else who can.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@CodeReborn](https://twitter.com/CodeReborn)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy reading, basketball, working out and eating a vegan diet.
